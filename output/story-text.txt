In Texas, almost 66 percent of residents live in Census tracts where the response score is above the national average. The number jumps when looking at just Hispanics; 85 percent of state's Hispanic residents live in those tracts. And 84 percent of residents who live under the poverty line live in those tracts as well, according to Census data from 2010 to 2014.
